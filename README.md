# MT-RCA
A Multi-task Deep Learning Network Combining Residual Networks (ResNet) and Cross-attention.
This is the code implementation for the method used in our paper 'Correlation-Driven Multi-Task Learning for MRI-Based Joint Prediction of Placenta Accreta Spectrum and Postpartum Hemorrhage.
## Requirements
Our models are trained and tested in the environment of Python 3.8, R 4.2.2, PyTorch 1.9.1, CUDA 11.1.
